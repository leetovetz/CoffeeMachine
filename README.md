# CoffeeMachine
Coffee Machine project in Java. <br>
From JetBrains Academy (hyperskill.org).<br>

**About**<br>
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? <br>
A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. <br>
It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine <br>
and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach <br>
the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work <br>
on programming a coffee machine simulator. <br>
The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, <br>
and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, <br>
it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: <br>
espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, <br>
it also collects the money.<br>

**Thoughts**<br>
Project evolves through six stages, starting <br>
with just printing out the steps of making a coffee, <br>
through adding in water, milk, beans fields, <br>
finally ending with a full-fledged coffee machine that <br>
can be re-filled and money taken out of. <br>
Last stage involves designing a state machine using enums. <br>
Overall, a good project to work through.<br>
